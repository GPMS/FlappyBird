# Flappy Bird Clone

A flappy bird clone made in Unity/C#.

Trying out making this simple game to prove my Unity skills instead of just following tutorials.

Surprisingly, I had never actually played flappy bird before so I used a few references online for the gameplay listed bellow.

Since the focus is on the programming and related functionality of the Engine, I used art assets obtained online instead of rolling out some of my own.
